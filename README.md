# ncdb-data-dictionary
A data dictionary is a compilation of information pertaining to and describing the contents, format, and structure of a database and the relationship between its elements. A data dictionary may be used to control access to and manipulation of the database.

Unfortunately, when presented in `HTML` format, a data dictionary is essentially useless to researchers. On the other hand, when converted to a JSON object that is malleable and easily trasportable, the data dicitonary becomes a powerful tool for researchers 

*In this project, the Python module BeautifulSoup4 is used to parse raw html from the [NCDB's public use file](http://ncdbpuf.facs.org/node/259?q=print-pdf-all) into a dictionary, which is then converted into a JSON object.*
