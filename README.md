# ncdb-data-dictionary
A data dictionary is a compilation of information pertaining to and describing the contents, format, and structure of a database and the relationship between its elements. A data dictionary may be used to control access to and manipulation of the database.

Unfortunately, when presented in `HTML` format, a data dictionary is basically useless to researchers. On the other hand, when converted to a JSON object that is malleable and easily trasportable, the data dicitonary becomes a powerful tool for researchers 

*In this project, I used the Python module BeautifulSoup4 to parse raw html from the NCDB's public use file into a Python dicitonary, which I then converted to a JSON object.*
