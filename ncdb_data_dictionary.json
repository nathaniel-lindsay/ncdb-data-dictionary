Some facilities may have been in a Network throughout the time period in the PUF, whereas others may have only recently become part of a Network. Additionally, facilities designated in the Network category could previously been assigned a different category before joining their Network, such as Community, Academic, etc. Keep this in mind when analyzing facility type data, as Networks are comprised of several different types of facilities, but are only classified as Integrated Network Cancer Program in the PUF data. The hospital category in the PUF only represents the current designation of the facility.      See  Data De-identification and Confidentiality for a description of the handling of some categories.

Lower numbered codes take precedence over higher numbered codes.  The code must be changed to a lower code if a more definitive method confirms the diagnosis at any time during the course of the disease.  Code 3 in the table below does NOT apply to solid tumors.      Separate rules were established for non-solid tumors (histology codes 9590-9992) in 2010.  Prior to that, registrars were instructed to use Code 1 for positive hematologic findings and bone marrow specimens for leukemia, including peripheral blood smears and aspiration biopsies.  Otherwise, to use Code 2 for positive brushings, washings, cell aspiration, and hematologic findings (except for leukemia).      For non-solid tumors (histology codes 9590-9992) beginning in 2010, the table below is NOT hierachical, and the rules for assignment are specific to non-solid tumors.      Coding Instructions for All Tumors      Assign Code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy, D&C or from aspiration or biopsy of bone marrow specimens.      Assign Code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on cytologic examination of cells such as sputum smears, bronchial brushings, bronchial washings, prostatic secretions, breast secretions, gastric fluid, spinal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical or vaginal smears, or from paraffin block speciments from concentrated spinal, pleural or peritoneal fluid.  These methods are rarely used for hematopoietic or lymphoid tumors.      Assign Code 5 when the diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests or marker studies which are clinically diagnostic for that cancer.      Assign Code 6 when the diagnosis is based only on the surgeon's operative report or from a surgical exploration or endoscopy or from gross autopsy findings in the absence of tissue or cytologic findings.      Additional Coding Instructions for Hematopoietic or Lymphoid Tumors (Histologies 9590-9992)      There is no priority hierachy for coding Diagnostic Confirmation for hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors.  Most commonly, the specific histologic type is diagnosed by immunophenotypoing or genetic testing.  See the Hematopoietic Database (DB) for information on the definitive diagnostic confirmation for specific tumors.      For leukemia only, assign Code 1 when the diagnosis is based only on the complete blood count (CBC), white blood count (WBC) or peripheral blood smear.  Do not use Code 1 if the diagnosis was based on immunophenotyping or genetic testing using tissue, bone marrow, or blood.      Assign Code 3 when there is a histologic positive for cancer AND positive immuniphenotyping and/or postiive genetic testing results.  Do not use Code 3 for neoplasms diagnosed prior to January 1, 2010.      Assign Code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method that can not be coded as 6 or 7.  A number of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms are dignosed by tests of exclusion where the tests for the disease are equivocal and the physician makes a clinical diagnosis based on the information from the equivocal tests and the patient's clinical presentation.      Assign Code 6 when the diagnosis is based only on the surgeon's operative report from a surgical exploration or endocscopy or from gross autopsy findings in the absence of tissue or cytologic findings.      Assign Code 1 when microscopic diagnosis is based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy or D&C or from aspiration of biopsy bone marrow specimens.      Assign Code 2 when microscopic diagnosis is based on cytologic examination of cells such as sputum smears, bronchial brushings, bronchial washings, prostatic secretions, breast secretions, gastric fluid, peritoneal fluid, urinary sediment, or peritoneal fluid.

For cases diagnosed January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2007, the CoC required registries to copy the staging elements from a standardized document found in the patient record, as recorded by the managing physician. PUF users may notice an increase in the proportion of cases with cT reported as X as a consequence of the CoC restriction on the allowable range of registry coding of information beyond that documented by the managing physician.      The rules changed again with cases diagnosed in 2008.  Beginning with 2008 diagnoses, registrars were required to record clinical stage.  If it was not available from a physician, it was to be coded from information available in the patient record.      Cases are coded using the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual edition in use during the year in which the case was diagnosed.  Consult the appropriate edition of this manual for organ or site specific codes and their definitions.  See AJCC TNM Edition Number (NAACCR Item #1060).  Prior to implementation of the 5th edition of the manual, some \"slippage\" in version occurred, and edition numbers are not included in the PUF for those older cases.       Codes on this list comprise all codes valid for any AJCC manual through the 7th edition and for any chapter.  Please consult the applicable manual and chapter for codes that are valid for specific site, histology and AJCC edition combinations. Starting with the 2015 PUF (released in Fall 2017), clinical T has been backward converted to include c prefixes.      There is no standard mechanism to recode AJCC items from one edition to another.

        "analytical note": "Using the Site Specific Factors from the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System      Several PUF projects will examine one or more laboratory prognostic indicators.  These are available as Site Specific Factors (SSF) collected as part of the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System (CS).  The term \"collaborative\" means that the data collection tool was devised to meet the various needs of cancer registry data standard setters such as the Commission on Cancer (CoC), Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), and the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR).       Up to 25 data fields are used to collect SSFs.  Being site specific, they contain different information depending on the type of cancer in the report.  For example, for breast cancer reports SSF1 contains \"Estrogen Receptor (ER) Assay\" results, but for colon cancer reports SSF1 contains \"Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)\" results.       SSFs also may convey non-laboratory site specific information that is relevant to prognosis for some cases.  For example, SSF1 for gastric cancers is \"Clinical Assessment of Regional Lymph Nodes\", and for melanoma of skin it is \"Measured Thickness (Depth), Breslow Measurement\".      Some detective work is required to identify the data fields of interest, the applicable codes, and the adequacy of the data for the particular study.       The codes, and occasionally the fields used, for a particular prognostic factor changed over time.  In the PUF the SSF data are retained in the form in which they were submitted. That means that it will be necessary to identify the CS Version Numbers that are used in the PUF file, and use those to identify whether the data contents for the desired SSF may have changed or moved over time.  Links to the site-specific codes can be found at http://ncdbpuf.facs.org/?q=node/370.        The quality of the SSF data items has undergone minimal review by NCDB, and PUF users are advised to examine the data consistency and completeness of these items carefully before proceeding with the study.       All SSF data items are edited for validity and internal consistency before the case report is submitted, and the submitter is required to correct any edit errors.  However, some coding errors remain.        Case coverage of the SSFs is limited for a variety of reasons, potentially seriously affecting their applicability for some studies.       The availability of the measures to hospital registrars at the time of data entry is sparse for many prognostic measures.  The source of information is usually the laboratory report as it appears in the hospital patient record.  The information may not be available in the hospital if it was requested by a physician and the report was sent to the physician's office.  Or it may be delayed and not picked up later.      The individual tests are not run at all locations or for all patients, even if the test is part of an acknowledged treatment protocol.       Finally, many hospital registries began abstracting data for the years the measures were introduced prior to the hospital's upgrade of the software necessary to collect those items, and they did not necessarily return to the cases to abstract the missed data.  No SSFs are available for cases diagnosed prior to 2004.  Some of the items were first introduced in 2004, and are underrepresented for cases diagnosed that year compared to later years.  Most prognostic SSFs were introduced in 2010, and are certainly underrepresented for 2010 diagnoses; they are not available at all for earlier years.      The SSFs in use in for Versions 2.02 through the current version and whether the field was required for CoC registries are described in http://seer.cancer.gov/csreqstatus/index.html.   To access the list of Site-Specific Factors required by the Commission on Cancer, click the \"Get Started\" button in the Collaborate Stage Requirements Status box on the right-hand side of the page. Then, press the plus sign in the middle of the page, select \"Required Factors\" as Report, \"CoC\" as the Standard Setter, and the applicable version under Version. As noted above, the fields in which these items were stored and the codes used may have changed over time.      Please direct questions about the use of SSFs to NCDB_PUF@facs.org.",
